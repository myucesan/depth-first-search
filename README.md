This exercise is inspired by ADS. This is not exam-level material for AD, but meant as a useful exercise to practice with the concept of recursion.

Implement the search method which takes a BinaryTree and int as input and tries to find the specified element in the tree.

This search has to be done recursively, without using additional data structures.
